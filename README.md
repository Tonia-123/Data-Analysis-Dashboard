# Telco Customer Churn Analysis
## Project Overview 
This project analyzes customer churn for a telecommunications company using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. Churn refers to when customers leave the company and stop using its services. Understanding churn is critical for telecom businesses because retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The dataset includes customer demographics, account information, and service usage details. By analyzing this data, the project aims to:

•	Identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn.

•	Segment customers based on their likelihood of leaving.

•	Provide actionable insights to reduce churn and improve retention.
