# Telco Customer Churn Analysis
Project Overview 
This project analyzes customer churn for a telecommunications company using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. Churn refers to when customers leave the company and stop using its services. Understanding churn is critical for telecom businesses because retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The dataset includes customer demographics, account information, and service usage details. By analyzing this data, the project aims to:
•	Identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn.
•	Segment customers based on their likelihood of leaving.
•	Provide actionable insights to reduce churn and improve retention.

 Tools Used:
•	Excel: Data cleaning, feature creation and trend analysis..
•	Power BI: Interactive dashboards and advanced visualizations for stakeholder reporting.https://github.com/Tonia-123/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Telco.png

 Key Steps In Project
1.	Data Cleaning & Preparation 
Handled missing values 
Standardized data types (dates, numeric columns).
Created new features such as Customer Tenure Group

2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
Compared churn vs non-churn customers.
Analyzed churn across demographics.
Studied impact of contract type, payment method and monthly charges.

       3.Insights & Patterns 
•	Females churn slightly more (13) than males (10), despite females being a larger group.
•	Customers with month-to-month contracts show the highest churn. Those on one-year or two-year contracts have no churn recorded.
•	Most churn happens in the 0-12 months tenure group, showing new customers are most likely to leave early.

4.Dashboard Creation
Power BI: Dynamic dashboard with slicers for churn rate by demographics, services and tenure.

      5.Recommendations
•	Focus retention efforts on customers with month-to-month contracts, as they are most likely to leave.
•	Improve onboarding and engagement for new customers in their first year to reduce early churn.
•	Gender differences in churn seem small but can be explored further for campaigns especially for females.
•	Encourage longer-term contract subscriptions by highlighting benefits and offering incentives, since these have zero churn in this data.
